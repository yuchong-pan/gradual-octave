\begin{abstract}
    In this proposal, we outline the general milestones and approaches that will
    be taken for our project of introducing gradual typing to Octave and provide
    brief motivation for the subject area. Further, we argue that the project is
    low-risk and interesting as a term project by showing relevant pieces of
    supportive literature and open-sourced projects and contend that there is
    much potential in future extensions.
